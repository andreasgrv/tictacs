Machine learning pipeline setup on steroids (on tictacs actually)

## Description
This module is an attempt to move the creation of machine learning pipelines away from the code and into the configuration files where they belong. When there, they can be processed much easier and can even be automatically generated easier once this intermediate step exists.

## Naming
Influenced by a oneliner joke made by stand up comedian Milton Jones - in machine learning tasks we need tactics when tackling problems! (as well as humour to wiggle out of a tight spot when our system doesn't work).
